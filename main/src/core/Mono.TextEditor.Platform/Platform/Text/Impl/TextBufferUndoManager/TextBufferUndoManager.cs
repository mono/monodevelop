        /// is as follows:
        ///
        /// Originally this was done for VB commit, which uses undo events (i.e. TransactionCompleted) to 
        /// trigger commit.  Their commit logic relies on the buffer being in a state such that applying 
        /// an edit synchronously raises a Changed event (which is always the case for PostChanged, but 
        /// not for Changed if there are nested edits).
        ///
        /// JaredPar made a change (CS 1182244) that allowed VB to detect that UndoTransactionCompleted 
        /// was being fired from a nested edit, and therefore delay the actual commit until the following 
        /// PostChanged event.
        ///
        /// So this allowed us to move TextBufferUndoManager back to adding undo actions directly 
        /// from the TextBufferChanged handler (CS 1285117).  This is preferable, as otherwise there's a 
        /// "delay" between when the edit happens and when we record the edit on the undo stack, 
        /// allowing other people to stick something on the undo stack (i.e. from 
        /// their ITextBuffer.Changed handler) in between.  The result is actions being "out-of-order" 
        /// on the undo stack.
        ///
        /// Unfortunately, it turns out VB snippets actually rely on this "out-of-order" behavior
        /// (see Dev10 834740) and so we are forced to revert CS 1285117) and return to the model
        /// where we queue up edits and delay adding them to the undo stack until PostChanged.
        ///
        /// It would be good to revisit this at again, but we would need to work with VB
        /// to fix their snippets / undo behavior, and verify that VB commit is also unaffected.
