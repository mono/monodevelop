OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES

Hidden classes

Loop type analysis
-------------

The body of a loop is scanned for assignment expressions.  For each assignment expression, the
static type is determined (if possible) and recorded against the loop.  If the type recorded
for a variable does not change (note that int32 -> number is possible and does not prohibit
optimization) then the variable used to store the reference can be changed to the static type
and type conversions can be eliminated.  The following conditions prohibit the use of this
optimization:
* Use of eval()
* Use of "arguments"
* A call to a nested function that references the variable


Loop peeling
------------

Often the type of a variable is not known for the first iteration of a loop but is known for
subsequent iterations.  To optimize this case the first iteration is "peeled off" and executed
separately.  This optimization is always safe.


Loop-invariant code motion
--------------------------

Sections of the parse tree that are not modified during a loop body can be hoisted above the
loop and replaced with a variable lookup.  Sections of the parse tree with side-effects cannot
be hoisted; this includes:
* Function calls
* A new expression
* Property access (because of getter functions)
