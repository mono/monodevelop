High priority:
* Track when program is running on device in order to show output.
* Show filtered logcat output while a program is running or debugging.
* Stop program when done so we can re-launch it for the debugger.
* Use device properties to improve listing in the device chooser GUI.
* Code completion for GUI definition xml files using xsd from VS addin.
* Bugfixing.

Medium priority:
* Package publishing wizard to sign release build with release key.
* Check whether target device has enough temp space (e.g. emulator).
* Set asset build action automatically when adding files to Asset folder.
* More options GUIs as needed - add options GUIs for any 
  additional build options, such as the linker.
* Dialog for additional options when launching emulators.
* Nicer device management in the pad.
* Filtering for the device log.

Low priority:
* Port more adb operations to direct TCP communication.
* Allow user to associate friendly names with device serials.
* Unify the android and iphone device log pads.
* Unify the android and iphone upload command IDs.
* Code completion for GUI definition xml files driven from the code 
  completion db like the XAML completion.
* Code completion schema for AndroidManifest.xml (maybe Eclipse
  has one?).
* Debugger visualizers & formatters for android types.
* Unit testing integration & templates.

There are also misc minor FIXMEs and TODOs in the source.
