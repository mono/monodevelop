CorApi and CorApi2 are samples taken from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=19621 with our own API changes added to it.

API changes are to be marked with [Xamarin] tags.
*For additions of properties or changes to existing properties, apply the tag to the property explaining the fix applied.

API changes are to be done with tabs as it's easier to differentiate between their code and our code.

Post-update API changes can be applied with this commit:
