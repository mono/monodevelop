MonoDevelop is a full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for mono
and Gtk#. See http://www.monodevelop.com for more info.  

Directory organization
----------------------

	There are two main directories:

	  * main: The core MonoDevelop assemblies and add-ins (all in a single
	    tarball/package).
	  * extras: Additional add-ins (each add-in has its own
	    tarball/package).

Compiling
---------

	If you are building from Git, make sure that you initialize the submodules
	that are part of MonoDevelop, to do this execute:

	git submodule update --init --recursive

	To compile execute:

	./configure
	make

	There are two variables you can set when running 'configure':

	  --prefix=/path/to/prefix: To set the install prefix.

	    you can use --prefix=`pkg-config --variable=prefix mono` to get MD
	    installed with the rest of mono/gtk-sharp/etc.

	  --profile=profile-name: To choose one build profile.
	
	There are some predefined profiles:

	  * stable: builds the MonoDevelop core and some stable extra add-ins.
	  * core: builds the MonoDevelop core only.
	  * all: builds everything

	You can create your own profiles if you need to. To create a profile you
	only have to add a file to the profiles directory containing a list
	of the directories to build.

	You can run MonoDevelop from the build directory without having to
	install it by executing:

	make run

Installing
----------

	Installing is currently optional.
	(Use make run to use MonoDevelop without installing.)

	make install

	(It's possible that you need to install for your locale to be
	correctly set.)

Packaging for OSX
-----------------

	To package MonoDevelop for OSX in a convenient MonoDevelop.app
	file, just do this after MonoDevelop has finished building (with
	make):

		cd main/build/MacOSX
		make MonoDevelop.app
