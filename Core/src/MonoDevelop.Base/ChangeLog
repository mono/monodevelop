	help understand what it does.
	* Gui/Pads/OpenTaskView.cs: Keep track of added tasks. TaskService

	* Internal/Project/Project/AbstractProject.cs: Make sure that
	references of references are copied in properly. This code needs to
	be refactored. However, this does work. We should basically be walking

	the pathing so it works without an existing setup.

2004-05-30  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* Services/ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: Don't use the "Gac:"
	  prefix to reference gac assemblies, they are handled internally by
	  AssemblyCodeCompletionDatabase.
	  When locating an assembly database, take into account partial names,
	  and avoid loading the same db twice.
	  Perform the modified file check taking into account dependencies
	  between databases. This increases the posibility of resolving all classes
	  of a database in the first parse cycle (since its dependecies will be
	  already parsed).
	  Added parameter to GetClass which allows deep search of a class in all
	  project references.
	  In ResolveTypes, added out parameter to inform if all types could be
	  resolved.
	  In ClassInheritanceEnumerator, use a reference deep search to get base
	  classes.
	  
	* IParserService.cs: Added parameter to GetClass which allows deep search of
	  a class in all project references.
	  
	* CodeCompletionDatabase.cs: Increased db version, since the format has
	  changed a bit. Added an easy way for derived classes to serialize data
	  together with the index.
	  When writing the db, make a byte copy from the old file to the new one
	  for classes not loaded.
	  In ProjectCodeCompletionDatabase, if a file can't be fully resolved,
	  schedule a reparse.
	  In GetClass() support lookup of inner classes. Improved some internal
	  methods to support this.

2004-05-29  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

2004-05-26  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Gui/Dialogs/ReferenceDialog/SelectReferenceDialog.cs: fix up
	per edd's suggestions. Now we select a valid node if possible when
	you remove, and the remove button is only sensitive when an iter is
	selected.

2004-05-26  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* Services/ProjectService/DefaultProjectService.cs: move the call to
	GenerateMakefiles when the solution is closed to somewhere that

2004-05-26  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	a *strange* nullref that keeps popping up.

2004-05-26  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* Services/ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: Type names for fields,
	  parameters, base classes and so on come unresolved from the parser
	  (without namespace information). They must be resolved before adding them
	  to the database. This is done through the method ResolveTypes.
	* CodeCompletionDatabase.cs: Resolve type names before adding the class to
	  the database.
	* PersistentIndexer.cs, PersistentParameter.cs, PersistentMethod.cs,
	  PersistentReturnType.cs, PersistentEvent.cs, PersistentField.cs,

	  provide information about the source project in the args.
	  
	* Services/Project/IProjectService.cs: Added new reference events.
	
	* ParserService/DefaultParserService.cs: Mostly reimplemented. The new
	  implementation uses a unified data structure for storing information
	  from projects and assemblies.
	  
	* Services/ParserService/AssemblyInformation.cs: Added FileName property.
	
	* Services/ParserService/IParserService.cs: Added IProject parameter to

	  method to update the tree from parse event args.
	  
	* Gui/Pads/ProjectBrowser/BrowserNode/ProjectBrowserNode.cs,

	  Internal/Parser/PersistenceLayer/PersistentClass.cs,
	  New implementation of read and write methods based on static methods. In
	  this way it can be used to write instances of any IClass and not only
	  PersistentClass. Also use new helper methods for writing strings and
	  object references.
	  
	* Internal/Parser/IClass.cs: Moved ClassInheritanceTree to IParserService.

	* Gui/Dialogs/ReferenceDialog/GacReferencePanel.cs:
	Now we actually pull assemblies from the gac.
	NOTE: Until gtk-sharp, and other libraries actually start using the gac
	it will not be possible to add a proper gac reference to them.
	This will be fixed on their end by beta1 however.

	* Internal/Project/Project/IncludeFilesDialog.cs:
	* Internal/Project/Combine/Combine.cs:
	* Internal/Project/Combine/CombineEntry.cs:

	Commit basically sets up the skeleton for the GenerateMakefiles stuff.
	Right now all the real code is in the LanguageBinding, where it
	should be (I think). Anyone looking to add this functionality to their
	LanguageBinding is welcome too, however the api and setup may change
	while the C# implementation is being written, so there are no
	promises at all.

	Now the docs show up on code completion tooltips, just the summary.
	Potentially we should enable the entire doc for the class/method,
	but I havnt seen how it looks yet, as it will most likely be large
	for some methods/classes.

	**NOTE: To get this documentation integration, you have to rebuild
	your code completion database.

	and not static.
